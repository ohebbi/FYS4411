# FYS4411 - Computational Physics II: Quantum Mechanical Systems
This is the public repository for the master-subject FYS4411 at the University of Oslo and it is the product of the collaboration between Mohamed Ismail & Oliver Hebnes.

This course is an advanced course on computational physics with an emphasis on quantum mechanical systems with many interacting particles. The applications and the computational methods are relevant for research problems in such diverse areas as nuclear, atomic, molecular and solid-state physics, chemistry and materials science.
The course consists of two main projects, where you will find more information resting within each folder.


# Project 1

## Variational Monte Carlo
The aim of this project is to use the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC)
method and evaluate the ground state energy of a trapped, hard sphere Bose
gas for different numbers of particles with a specific trial wave function.

# Project 2

## Restricted Boltzmannn Machine
The aim of this project is to use the restricted Boltzmann machine
(RBM) on a system of two interacting electrons
(or bosons) confined to move in a harmonic oscillator trap and evaluate the ground state energy using VMC.
